## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Kill any existing process on port 5000
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart backend
cd backend
npm start
```

### Database error
```bash
# Delete old database and reseed
rm backend/swim_school.db
cd backend
npm run seed
npm start
```

### Frontend won't connect to backend
- Check backend is running: http://localhost:5000 should show error
- Check CORS is enabled (it is, by default)
- Check no firewall blocking port 5000

### Can't login
- Verify backend is running
- Use correct credentials (max@example.com / password123)
- Check browser console for errors

## 💾 Data Persistence

All data is saved to SQLite database (`swim_school.db`):
